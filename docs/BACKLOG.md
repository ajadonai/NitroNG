# Backlog

The one list. When something ships it moves to Closed with its commit, so it
never gets picked up twice. Update this in the same commit as the work.

## Open

- **Reseller API follow-ups** (v2 of the API, not started): drip-feed and
  multi-day parameters, webhooks, per-key IP allowlists. Brief:
  `docs/v2/reseller_api_brief.md`.
- **Onboarding funnel, second read** — after ~30 days of `firstSeenWalletAt` /
  `firstSeenNewOrderAt` data (from 26 Aug 2026), rerun the funnel and see where
  the 74% who never pay actually stop.
- **Outreach re-engagement** — the ~2,000 signups a month who never start a
  payment. **Paused (26 Aug 2026): no staff.** The whole outreach machine is
  off via Admin → Outreach → Pause (`outreach_paused` setting); resume there
  when there is a team again, then pick this up.
- **Cohort / ops** — anything the nightly cohort check surfaces (see the
  protected routes in CLAUDE.md).

## Closed

| Date | Item | Commit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-28 | Tasks on both sides, crew payouts and bulk order rows open with the shared look (`lib/expandable-card.js`). Remaining expandables are drawers and modals, which are a different thing | `5aaf76ea` v2.4.13 |
| 2026-08-28 | "Which tier?" rebuilt 1:1 to the approved mock: three tap-to-pick columns, tinted head, facts on rails, Most pick badge, selected state, Good/Better/Best and Normal/Priority/First wording; platform picker keeps its structure with the mock's finish (58/54px tiles, 16/15px icons, 10px labels, soft surfaces, "All N platforms" line) | `556f5e76` v2.4.12 |
| 2026-08-28 | Pulse: third row of month facts (Bonuses, Payouts, Refunds, Cancel rate, Idle wallets; `monthRefunds` added to the API) and the Platforms bar in brand colours via `lib/platform-brand.js` | `3e15dfcb` v2.4.11 |
| 2026-08-28 | Full catalogue orderable: `resolveVisible` and the order path no longer require `Service.enabled` for a full-catalogue reseller; listed + priced + mtp/dao is the rule on both sides | `26a73dcd` v2.4.10 |
| 2026-08-28 | `voidCommissions` retries transient connection drops (idempotent), and `/api/cron/commission-sweep` (02:30 nightly) voids any commission still live on a cancelled order and raises a warning if it had to | `b19d688e` v2.4.9 |
| 2026-08-27 | Trip's four: the duplicate "need help ordering" line under search results removed, opened order rows framed like opened service cards on both sides with the header tinted deeper than its body, Pulse deposit channels coloured per method, and every button answers the hand (lift on hover, sink on press, reduced-motion respected) | `0719f4c8`, `68d2269c` v2.4.8 |
| 2026-08-27 | Copy buttons on Referrals and the API docs work again: the v2.4.4 clipboard sweep shadowed a same-named local, so `copyText` called itself until the stack blew and the surrounding catch swallowed it | `69610f64` v2.4.7 |
| 2026-08-27 | Gradual orders schedule at any hour and any size: each day's batches get a span budget so they fit inside that day, and a day is the 24 hours from its own anchor unless a delivery window makes it a calendar day | `71144835` v2.4.6 |
| 2026-08-27 | Versioning rule states what earns a milestone, and that a long patch run is the healthy case | `f1214c0b` v2.4.5 |
| 2026-08-27 | Admin side, compact and clean — every named piece is in place: sidebar sections with separators (`admin-dashboard.jsx`), reseller programme tiles including "On full catalogue" (`admin-resellers.jsx`), the Tasks submissions review queue with approve/reject (`admin-tasks.jsx`), the Users-list chip. Nothing further is specified; reopen with a named page if one still reads wrong | verified, `20cd8c59` |
| 2026-08-26 | Reseller and API chips on admin orders and the users list, `Placed from` on the order facts; disabled profiles no longer count as resellers; changelog entry for the API launch | `20cd8c59` v2.4.5 |
| 2026-08-26 | Six Sentry issues: Meta CAPI retry and classification, registration through the outbox, clipboard never throws, Prisma read retry, Redis outages are warnings | `7a7f85dd` v2.4.4 |
| 2026-08-26 | Pulse and Live rebuilt: full viewport, fullscreen, people first, today's figures on their own day lines | `d81f7de1`, `8342a73d` v2.4.2–3 |
| 2026-08-26 | Outreach paused with a switch every outreach cron honours (Admin → Outreach) | `ce5fea5a` v2.4.1 |
| 2026-08-26 | Reseller API carries instructions: `description` and standard `type` on every service, `add` accepts comment lists and traffic targeting | `9acf854a`, `97039c60` v2.4 |
| 2026-08-26 | Reseller API carries instructions: `description` (group note, Discord bot setup with the live link, traffic and comment parameters) and a standard `type` on every service; `add` accepts comments/usernames/keywords and traffic targeting | v2.4 |
| 2026-08-26 | API keys for every verified account at retail; wholesale by approval on the same key; HQ tab in the nav for everyone | `27001ab9` v2.3.2 |
| 2026-08-26 | Reseller HQ merged with the public resellers page: one component in two states, no child panel; key in HQ and Settings (`/api/reseller/key`, read + rotate); docs at `/resellers/docs`; catalogue points at both | `b0d4a6a3` v2.3.1 |
| 2026-08-26 | Reseller API: `POST /api/v2` in the SMM convention, one order path for web and API (`createOrderForSession`, `patchOrderForSession`, `refillOrderForSession`), curated vs full decided by the key, 584 missing IDs minted (map now 9,806) | `e277fcce` v2.3 |
| 2026-08-26 | Backlog starvation in outreach: priority touches are budget-aware, Backlog keeps a floor of 15 | `815f9655` v2.2.36 |
| 2026-08-26 | Failed deposits: 373/30d were abandoned checkouts (`provider_not_found`), now read "Not completed"; real rejections stay red | `64b17b3e` v2.2.37 |
| 2026-08-26 | Hand-built modals (Rewards, Settings, Home popups) moved onto the `Modal` primitive | `4a27b858` v2.2.38 |
| 2026-08-26 | Full-catalogue name cleanup for resellers: bracket facts → attributes, per-category dedupe, tails without flags, ≤80 chars | `9623e463` v2.2.39 |
| 2026-08-26 | Untracked agent-tooling folders (`.agents`, `.codex`, `.21st`, `.github/{agents,hooks,skills}`) gitignored | `9623e463` |
| 2026-08-26 | First-seen timestamps for Wallet and New Order, with a governed migration | `2b9711e5` v2.2.35 |
| 2026-08-26 | Dashboard redesign round: Orders (both sides), New Order + bulk + modal, Tasks, Home, Settings, Wallet, theme switch, dock, sharper tokens, ground wash and grain | v2.2.20 – v2.2.34 |
