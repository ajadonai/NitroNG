# Backlog

The one list. When something ships it moves to Closed with its commit, so it
never gets picked up twice. Update this in the same commit as the work.

## Open

- **Reseller API follow-ups** (v2 of the API, not started): drip-feed and
  multi-day parameters, webhooks, per-key IP allowlists. Brief:
  `docs/v2/reseller_api_brief.md`.
- **Onboarding funnel, second read** — after ~30 days of `firstSeenWalletAt` /
  `firstSeenNewOrderAt` data (from 26 Aug 2026), rerun the funnel and see where
  the 74% who never pay actually stop.
- **Outreach re-engagement** — the ~2,000 signups a month who never start a
  payment. **Paused (26 Aug 2026): no staff.** The whole outreach machine is
  off via Admin → Outreach → Pause (`outreach_paused` setting); resume there
  when there is a team again, then pick this up.
- **Cohort / ops** — anything the nightly cohort check surfaces (see the
  protected routes in CLAUDE.md).
